<p>I recently switched roles in my career and education. Thanks to GitHub, Frontend Masters and development platforms too many to include. I previously worked as a author and freelance writer, but the growth in AI spurred me towards a software engineering career. I currently have continued to move forward with continuing education in this new exciting field that I have been introduced to and find the challenges are both stimulating and exactly what I enjoy doing with my time. Writing code and developing programs.</p>


<p>I am currently learning the algorithms necessary for scrypting and pursuing a role as Junior Developer</p>
